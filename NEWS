=======================

* lib: Document year is now indexed as a proper value, supporting both
  'year:<year>' binary and 'year:<year>..<year>' range searches.  Will
  require running 'restore' from the cli to re-index previously added
  articles.  Thanks to Rafael Laboissière for the contribution.

* lib: Much improved performance of Document prefixed term retrieval.

* cli: Much improved search output performance.  Default output limit
  of 20 has been removed.

* nci: Curses interface now loads entries dynamically, so search
  results are no longer limited.

* nci: Cleaner results display.  Document 'summary' has been removed,
  but other information has been added, such as journal article, year,
  file info, and document match information.

* nci: Extended navigation commands.

* sources: Now support PDF download from sources, if the source
  supports it.

* sources: New IACR 'crytoeprint' source.  Thanks to Daniel Kahn
  Gillmor for the contribution.
